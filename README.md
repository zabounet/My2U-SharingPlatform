# My2U

My2U is a school project which's aim was to put into practice everything we learnt (documentation included) during the year.

An expression of needs was given to us in order to develop an applicative solution for it.

I developped this application with my colleague [Alexis HUIN](https://github.com/AlexisHuin)

We wanted this project to be a challenge for us, so we went for completly unknown technologies and we're proud of the work we've put through.

***Note** : This project is coded and commented in french.*
***Note 2** : The web part is not functionnal. Efforts were put into the android version.*

## Front-end :
- React-Native
- Redux
- Json

## Back-end :
- NodeJS
- ExpressJs
- MongoDB

##

## Setup :
- This project uses Expo in order to make development easier and build the application.
- Eslint and pre-commit are present, although not configured.
- Jest and Supertest for testing back-end

#

##### I'm all open to suggestions and recommandation regarding the code of this project, especially concerning the back-end and Redux part !
